Proposed working project title
Evaluating AI's role in customer satisfaction and retention

Brief background
This question addresses the challenge of finding a good balance between efficiency and customer satisfaction in AI-driven customer service. AI use is continually increasing within the business model specifically in addressing customer interactions. As this increase occurs, it’s important to identify when AI is beneficial to customer relationships, and when it’s harmful. This insight can guide companies in using AI effectively without risking customer loyalty or driving up costs due to customer dissatisfaction without losing the beneficial aspects of AI

Question
How does the overuse of artificial intelligence in customer interactions affect customer satisfaction, error rates, and cost efficiency, and at what point does it lead to negative customer sentiment and a decrease in loyalty or sales?  

Hypothesis & Predictions
While the implementation of AI in retail settings improves cost efficiency and reduces errors, excessive reliance on AI in customer service without human interaction will lead to increased frustration. This will ultimately lower customer satisfaction and retention, with a noticeable drop in loyalty once a threshold of negative sentiment is reached. 

Sentiment analysis of customer reviews and feedback will show a correlation between the level of AI usage and negative sentiment. Initially, moderate AI usage may improve customer satisfaction by streamlining processes and reducing errors. However, as AI overuse increases, particularly in customer service and decision-making tasks that require empathy or human nuance, customers will express frustration. This sentiment will intensify when the perceived lack of human support coincides with issues such as service errors or theft, leading to reduced sales and loyalty for companies that overly depend on AI.
